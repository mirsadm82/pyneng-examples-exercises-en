Task 6.2a

Make a copy of the code from the task 6.2.

Add verification of the entered IP address.
An IP address is considered correct if it:
    - consists of 4 numbers (not letters or other symbols)
    - numbers are separated by a dot
    - every number in the range from 0 to 255

If the IP address is incorrect, print the message: 'Invalid IP address'

The message "Invalid IP address" should be printed only once,
even if several points above are not met.

Restriction: All tasks must be done using the topics covered in this and previous chapters.
